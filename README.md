## Code Disclaimer

Have fun reading through the code, but I wouldn't recommend a lot of it as a reference for newer developers. I take a lot of shortcuts during jams which would fall apart and make development painful for a larger project. I try to leave comments on especially bad parts where applicable, but as I get closer to the deadline I tend to toss things together in pretty haphazard ways :)
